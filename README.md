**AgenticAI-ComparativeStudy** is a portfolio-ready showcase of three intelligent agents built using different agentic AI frameworks: **CrewAI**, **N8N**, and **LangGraph**. This project explores how each framework supports task automation, decision-making, and agent collaboration in unique ways.

> 💡 Built as part of a comparative assignment to demonstrate the practical strengths, limitations, and capabilities of agent frameworks.

## 🚀 Overview

| Agent | Framework | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| ✅ `crewai-agent/` | CrewAI | Multi-agent meeting prep assistant |
| ✅ `n8n-agent/`    | N8N    | Weather chatbot with email automation |
| ✅ `langgraph-agent/` | LangGraph | Emotion-aware conversational agent |

Each project is contained in its own directory with documentation, code, and (optional) screenshots or videos.

## 🔍 Framework Comparison

| Feature              | CrewAI             | N8N                   | LangGraph               |
|----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Type                 | Python (code-based) | Visual UI (workflow)  | Python (graph-based)     |
| Best For             | Multi-role agents   | API automation         | Stateful flows, memory   |
| Memory Support       | Partial (context)   | No (stateless)         | Full state + branching   |
| Tool Integration     | High (OpenAI, Exa)  | Built-in + REST APIs   | High (LangChain tools)   |
| Dev Complexity       | Moderate            | Very Low               | Advanced (node/edge setup) |
