# LangGraph Agent â€“ Emotion-Aware Conversational Assistant

This project uses **LangGraph** to build a branching chatbot that routes user queries to different responses based on emotional tone.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Use Case

**Scenario:** A user interacts with a chatbot. Based on the message, the agent decides whether to:
- Respond with empathy (therapist style), or
- Respond with logic (analytical style)

## ðŸ§  Agent Flow Architecture

1. **Start Node:** Takes user input
2. **Classifier Node:** Determines if the query is emotional or logical
3. **Router Node:** Routes to Therapist Agent or Logic Agent
4. **Therapist Node:** Empathetic response (e.g., "I feel sad")
5. **Logic Node:** Factual answer (e.g., "Top 5 cars in 2024")
6. **End Node:** Conversation ends when user types "exit"
